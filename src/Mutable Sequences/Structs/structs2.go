/*
Comparison between structs depends on its fields.
Structs that are entirely composed of same types are comparable;
(those with slice or map fields are not comparable)

# In go , there is NO MAGIC METHODS for STRUCTS

Go doesnâ€™t allow comparisons between variables that represent STRUCTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES
(exception - anonymous structs)

Go allows you to perform a type conversion from one struct type to another if the fields of both
structs have the same names, order, and types .
