Go is a multi-purpose and general programming language , developed by Google in 2007. ![App Screenshot](https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/google-s-logo/150/Google_Icons-09-20.png)

Nowadays , it is majorly used to build robust **backends** üíø of different applications which needs features like **concurrency** for its scalability (to provide services to huge traffic). Go was built to act as a modern replacement of C by Google but it got its own place ü•à (yet we know , why C is the king of all languages) üëë.

Applications, which uses technologies like **Blockchain , Real-time communication or even ML (use for generic purposes also üòÑ )** , can take advantages of Go.

You can run **go** in any OS (Windows , Linux , Mac) üíª. Here , I will describe the **installation steps in Linux** only . For , other ways , have a look in the url attached - [link](https://go.dev/doc/install) üëÄ

## Installation in linux (boot or WSL)
The steps are as follows -

### Install the Script
- Go to ths link ‚û°Ô∏è [link](https://go.dev/dl/) . Click on the **.tar.gz** file under **Linux** section and one tar file will be downloaded in your system.

- For **WSL** users , check where the tar file is downloaded. Move the file to the location where your linux distro is saved.
- Then run the following command -
```bash
  tar -xzf <file-name>.tar.gz
```
- For **Fedora OS** users , run the following command -
```bash
  sudo dnf install golang
```

### Configure GOROOT and GOPATH

- **GOROOT** is the location where your extracted go executables are placed (extracted from **tar.gz** file)

To find the GOROOT location , run this command -
```bash
  whereis go
```
- Now let's configure the paths. Go projects typically follow a folder structure which is divided into 3 sections - **bin** , **pkg** , **src**.

- - **src** - contains actual go SOURCE CODES .

- - **pkg** - compiled versions of our imported go PACKAGES .

- - **bin** - compiled executable binaries of of our go SCRPTS .

- In first **GOPATH** , we give the location of that folder , where our imported packages will be stores in this sub-folder format (we don't need **src** here. Obviously ,
  we will not code in the imported package)

- In Second **GOPATH** , we give the location of that folder , where we will code our go projects. So , it must have proper folder structure

- The **export PATH =** line tells the system to add path of go projects / libraries binary directory to system's PATH .

- open your **.bashrc** ( and **.zshrc** if you use zsh file-system or any other additional file-system ) and paste these codes ( SUBSTITUTE THE FOLDER LOCATIONS ONLY ‚ùó )

```bash

  export GOROOT=/path/to/golang
  export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin
  
  export GOPATH=$GOPATH:/path/to/go-folder/programs

```

### Download essential libraries -

Open **/src** of your go workspace . open terminal . run the following commands which will help to install basic and necessary go tools (libraries)

```bash
  go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest

  go install golang.org/x/lint/golint@latest

```

### IDE
For me , Jetbrain's GOLAND is best environment where you can code in GO.
